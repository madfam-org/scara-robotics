CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Weakly Reciprocal

CERN-OHL-W v2

Copyright CERN 2020

This CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 (the "Licence") modifies the
terms under which a Licensor (as defined below) makes its work available.
Read it carefully before using, copying, modifying, making available or
distributing the work as doing so constitutes acceptance of this Licence.

1 Definitions

1.1 "Licence" means this CERN-OHL-W.

1.2 "Compatible Licence" means

     a) any version of the CERN-OHL-W, or

     b) any version of the CERN-OHL-S, or

     c) any licence which permits You to treat the Source and to which the
        work making Available Licencee's public licence grants the rights
        to copy, use, distribute and make Available under a licence
        compatible (or identical) to that licence.

1.3 "Source" means information such as design materials or digital code
    which can be applied to Make or test a Product or to prepare a Product
    for use, Conveyance or sale, regardless of its medium or how it is
    expressed. It may include Notices.

1.4 "Covered Source" means Source that is explicitly made available under
    this Licence.

1.5 "Product" means any device, component, work or physical object,
    whether in finished or intermediate form, arising from the use,
    application or processing of Covered Source.

1.6 "Make" means to create or configure something, whether by manufacture,
    assembly, compiling, loading or applying Covered Source or another
    Product or otherwise.

1.7 "Available Component" means any part, sub-assembly, library or code
    which:

     a) is licensed under a Compatible Licence, or

     b) is a 'standard part' whose primary purpose is not the same as
        that of the Product.

1.8 "External Material" means anything (including Source) which:

     a) is only combined with Covered Source in a way that interfaces
        with it using a documented interface specified in the Covered
        Source, and

     b) is not a derivative of or an addition to the Covered Source.

1.9 "Noticeably Marked" means described in each of:

     a) at least one of the following: online documentation, printed
        documentation, packaging, the User Interface, or

     b) a file in the format of the Covered Source

    Such notices must be sufficient to allow the recipient of any Product
    made using Covered Source to identify the Covered Source and to do so
    without undue difficulty.

1.10 "You" means the licensee of rights granted by this Licence.

1.11 "Licensor" means any person who creates or modifies Covered Source.
     There may be multiple Licensors of the same Covered Source.

1.12 "Convey" means to communicate to the public or to distribute.

2 Applicability

    This Licence governs the use, copying, modification, Making Available
    and Conveying of Covered Source. By exercising any right granted under

3 Copying, Modifying and Making Available Covered Source

3.1 You may copy and Convey verbatim copies of Covered Source, in any
    medium, provided You retain all Notices.

    You may only delete Notices if they are no longer applicable to the
    corresponding part of the Covered Source (for example, a notice that
    refers to a third-party licence that is no longer applicable to the
    part in question after your modification). Where Notices are not
    applicable to your modification, You must add Notices stating that
    You have modified the Covered Source, with the date and nature of the
    modification.

3.3 You may Make Available Covered Source provided that You:

     a) retain all Notices as required in subsection 3.2, and

     b) include a copy of this Licence with the Covered Source.

    a reference to the Source for that Product.

5 Research and Development

    You may use Covered Source internally for the purposes of research
    and development without having to release the Covered Source to others.
